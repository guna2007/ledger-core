## Application Flow

### Customer / User Flow

1. **Register** — User signs up via `POST /api/auth/register` with email, password, name, and phone.
2. **Verify Email** — An OTP is sent to the user's email. The user verifies via `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`. Login is blocked until verified.
3. **Login** — User logs in via `POST /api/auth/login`. Returns a JWT token. Unverified users are rejected.
4. **Create Account** — User creates one or more bank accounts (SAVINGS, CURRENT, FIXED_DEPOSIT) via `POST /api/accounts`.
5. **Deposit Funds** — User deposits money into their account via `POST /api/accounts/deposit`.
6. **View Accounts** — User views all their accounts via `GET /api/accounts`.
7. **Transfer Funds** — User transfers funds between any two accounts via `POST /api/transfer`. Both accounts must be ACTIVE.
8. **View Transactions** — User views transaction history for an account via `GET /api/transactions/{accountNumber}` or recent transactions via `GET /api/transactions/{accountNumber}/recent`.
9. **Apply for Loan** — User applies for a loan via `POST /api/loans`. Only one active loan allowed at a time. EMI is calculated automatically.
10. **Track Loans** — User views their loans via `GET /api/loans` or checks details of a specific loan.
11. **Repay Loan** — User repays their loan via `POST /api/loans/{loanId}/repay`. Partial payments are tracked. The loan status becomes PAID when fully repaid.
12. **Withdraw Funds** — User withdraws money from their account via `POST /api/accounts/withdraw`.

### Admin Flow

1. **Login** — Admin logs in with the seeded admin credentials (admin@bank.com / Admin@123).
2. **Review Pending Loans** — Admin views all pending and under-review loans via `GET /api/admin/loans/pending`.
3. **Mark Under Review** — Admin marks a pending loan as under review via `PUT /api/admin/loans/{loanId}/review`.
4. **Approve or Reject** — Admin approves or rejects a loan via `PUT /api/admin/loans/{loanId}/approve`. Approved loans remain in APPROVED status awaiting disbursement.
5. **Disburse Loan** — Admin disburses an approved loan via `PUT /api/admin/loans/{loanId}/disburse`. The loan amount is credited to the customer's first active account. Status becomes DISBURSED.
6. **View Loans by Status** — Admin filters loans by any status via `GET /api/admin/loans?status=PENDING`.
7. **View Any Loan** — Admin views any loan's full details via `GET /api/admin/loans/{loanId}`.

## API Modules

| Module         | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authentication | Register, Login, OTP Verification, Resend OTP                |
| Accounts       | Account Creation, Retrieval, Deposit, Withdrawal             |
| Transfers      | Secure Fund Transfers between accounts                       |
| Transactions   | Transaction History, Recent Transactions, Date Range Filter  |
| Loans          | Loan Application, Customer Loan List, Loan Repayment         |
| Admin          | Loan Review, Approval/Rejection, Disbursement, Status Filter |

## EMI Formula

```text
EMI = [P × R × (1 + R)^N] / [(1 + R)^N − 1]
```

Where:

* P = Principal Amount
* R = Monthly Interest Rate
* N = Loan Tenure in Months

---

## Local Setup

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone 
cd ledger-core
```

### Configure Environment

Copy the `.env` template and adjust values as needed:

```bash
# Database
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/smart_bank
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234

# SMTP (optional — email fails silently without valid credentials)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# JWT (must be ≥32 characters for HMAC-SHA256)
JWT_SECRET=YourSecretKeyHereAtLeast32CharsLong
JWT_EXPIRATION_MS=86400000

# Server
PORT=8080
```

The application also works without a `.env` file — all variables have sensible development defaults in `application.yml`.

### Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS smart_bank;
```

### Run Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Application URL:

```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

Default admin credentials (auto-seeded):

```
Email:    admin@bank.com
Password: Admin@123
```

## Testing

```bash
mvn test
```

### Testing Tools

* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* Postman
